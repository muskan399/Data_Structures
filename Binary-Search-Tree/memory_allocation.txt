Whenever we run a program, memory is allocated to it

1. Text: For storing instructions.
2. Global: For storing global and static variables.
3. Stack: For function calls and local variables.
4. Heap: 
    -> This is dynamic memory and its size can grow or shrink during runtime. 
    -> Whenever we use new operator or malloc, calloc, it takes space from this area of memory.
    -> We need to explicitly clear the space from here using delete, free keyword otherwise it takes space till the program execution          completes.

Note: See video: 29 for visualizing recursion.
